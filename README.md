# Simple weather analysis using python

Simple weather analysis of a given data set of a particular location using python. Here, the weather dataset is a time-series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure and weather description.

The data is available as a csv file. `analysis.ipynb` is the notebook demonstrating the analysis of this data using NumPy and Pandas.
